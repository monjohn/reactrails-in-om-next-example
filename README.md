# ReactRails in Om-Next

Test project to convert http://www.reactrails.com to [om-next](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-(om.next))

Here's the key functionality to support:

## Essentials
* Simple, single table model with no authentication.
* Handling async calls
* Simple validations, server and/or client

## Nice to Have
* Nice to show off some react features
* Deployable to heroku

Anything else to add to this list?
