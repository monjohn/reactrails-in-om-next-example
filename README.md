# ReactRails in Om-Next

(NOTE: Just found out from David Nolen that we want to do this in late December or early January due to some blocking issues for om-next)

Test project to convert http://www.reactrails.com to [om-next](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-(om.next))

Here's the key functionality to support:

## Essentials
* Simple, single table model with no authentication.
* Handling async calls
* Simple validations, server and/or client

## Nice to Have
* Nice to show off some react features
* Deployable to heroku
* Backend of Datomic

This is a good example: https://github.com/swannodette/om-next-demo

Anything else to add to this list?

Please submit PRs!

By the way, if there's an alternative ClojureScript framework that's preferable, let me know and I'll create a separate repo to compare that one.
